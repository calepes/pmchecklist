Product Management Checklist
===========

Start your next Product with this checklist and don't forget anything!


###RESEARCH

#####Hypothesis
A good hypothesis can be clearly refuted or supported by an experiment.

#####Vision
Sell the innovation, not the product. The best   measure is change in human behavior.

#####Stakeholders
Influence others to help them achieve their objectives without the direct authority to do so.


###DISCOVERY

#####Customer discovery
Search for the business model by talking to potential end users.

#####Customer personas
Help inform everything from more effective copy to product development.

#####Competitive analysis
Helps choose effective strategies that will improve the product’s competitive advantage.


###FEATURES

#####Prototype
Take a small step towards Product/Market Fit and being ready to scale.

#####Scope features
Defining purpose, describing features, setting release criteria, sketching rough timing.

#####Prioritizing features
Sets (and sequence) of things that should be done to deliver the most value at each point in time, given our constraints.


###METRICS

#####Roadmap
It bridges your work with everyone else’s and puts you back in control of your product.

#####Engagement
Understanding how a product is built to maximize and leverage user engagement.

#####Key performance indicators
Every new feature that is being considered should move the needle on the key metrics in A/B tests.


###UX

#####User Flow
Determine the intended interfaces, user flow and empty states.

#####Wireframes
Connect the underlying conceptual structure to the surface of the product.

#####Usability testing
The most effective way of understanding what works and what doesn’t is to watch people use the product.


###DEVELOPMENT

#####Acceptance criteria
The goal is for anyone on the team to be able to open a Story and know exactly what to expect. 

#####Methodology
The shift from a linear to an integrated approach encourages trial and error and challenges the status quo.

#####Documentation
A well-documented product is easier to use and iterate on.
